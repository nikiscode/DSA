#Linear_search
Linear search is the simplest searching technique.
It checks each element one by one until the target value is found or the list ends.

## No sorting required.

*Example
Array: [5, 3, 9, 1, 7]
Target: 1

#Steps:
Check 5 → not match
Check 3 → not match
Check 9 → not match
Check 1 → found 

##Pseudocode
LinearSearch(array, target):
    for i = 0 to length(array) - 1:
        if array[i] == target:
            return i
      return -1   // target not found

##Time Complexity: O(n)
Works on sorted or unsorted data
Simple and easy to implement
Slower for large datasets compared to binary search
