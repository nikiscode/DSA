#Merge_sort
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
It works by dividing the array into smaller parts, sorting them, and then merging them back together in order.

#Example
#Array:
[8, 3, 5, 2]
Step 1: Divide
[8, 3, 5, 2]
→ [8, 3]   [5, 2]
→ [8] [3] [5] [2]
Step 2: Merge (sort while merging)
[8] + [3] → [3, 8]
[5] + [2] → [2, 5]
Step 3: Final Merge
[3, 8] + [2, 5] → [2, 3, 5, 8]

##Pseudocode 
MergeSort(array, left, right)
    if left < right
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        MergeSort(array, left, mid)
        MergeSort(array, mid + 1, right)
        Merge(array, left, mid, right)

Merge(array, left, mid, right)
    create temp arrays L and R
    copy data into L and R
    merge L and R back into array in sorted order


*Uses Divide and Conquer
*Always runs in O(n log n) time
*Requires extra memory
*Very efficient for large datasets
*Used in real-world applications
