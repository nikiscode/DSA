   ## DSA
ðŸ’¡ DSA Made Simple

1. Array:
Stores elements in a continuous block of memory. Easy to access using index.

2. Linked List:
Elements (nodes) connected by links (pointers). Easy to insert or delete.

3. Stack:
LIFO â€“ Last In, First Out. Example: Undo feature, plates stack.

4. Queue:
FIFO â€“ First In, First Out. Example: Ticket line, printer queue.

5. Tree:
Hierarchical structure with parent and child nodes. Example: family tree, folder structure.

6. Graph:
Collection of nodes connected by edges. Used in maps, networks, social media.

7. Hashing:
Stores data using a keyâ€“value pair for fast access. Example: dictionary lookup.

8. Heap:
Tree-based structure used to find min or max quickly. Example: priority queue.

9. Searching:
Finding an element (Linear Search, Binary Search).

10. Sorting:
Arranging data in order (Bubble, Merge, Quick sort).

11. Recursion:
Function calling itself to solve smaller parts of a problem.

12. Backtracking:
Trying all possible ways and going back if one doesnâ€™t work. Example: maze solving.

13. Greedy:
Takes the best choice at each step for overall solution. Example: coin change.

14. Dynamic Programming (DP):
Breaking big problems into smaller ones and saving results. Example: Fibonacci.

15. Divide & Conquer:
Divides problem into parts, solves, and combines. Example: merge sort.
