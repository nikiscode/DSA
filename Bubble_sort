v  //Bubble_sort
Bubble Sort is an easy sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing two adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
After each pass, the largest element “bubbles up” to the end of the list.

#Example
Array:
[5, 3, 2, 4]
Pass 1:
Compare 5 & 3 → swap → [3, 5, 2, 4]
Compare 5 & 2 → swap → [3, 2, 5, 4]
Compare 5 & 4 → swap → [3, 2, 4, 5]

##Largest element 5 is now at the end.
Pass 2:
Compare 3 & 2 → swap → [2, 3, 4, 5]
Compare 3 & 4 → no swap

##Array is now sorted.

##Pseudocode
BubbleSort(array, n)
    for i = 0 to n-1
        for j = 0 to n-i-2
            if array[j] > array[j+1]
                swap array[j] and array[j+1]

*Simple and easy to understand
*Compares adjacent elements
*Time Complexity: O(n²) (not efficient for large data)
*Best for learning sorting concepts
