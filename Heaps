//heaps concepts 

A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies 
the heap property and is widely used in algorithms such as 

Graph Algorithms:

1. Definition of Heap
A Heap is a complete binary tree where each node satisfies the 
heap-order property.

2. Types of Heap:
• Min Heap
• Max Heap

A) Max Heap: Parent node value is always greater than or equal 

to its children.

B) Min Heap: Parent node value is always smaller than or equal 

to its children.

3. Properties of Heap

Structural Property:

- Heap is a complete binary tree.

- Height of heap is O(log n).

Heap Order Property:

- Max Heap: Parent ≥ Child

- Min Heap: Parent ≤ Child

4. Array Representation of Heap

For 0-based indexing:
Parent(i) = (i - 1) // 2

Left Child(i) = 2i + 1

Right Child(i) = 2i + 2

5. Heap Operations

Insert:

- Insert element at the end.

- Heapify upward.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Delete (Extract Max/Min):

- Replace root with last element.

- Heapify downward.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Peek:

- Access root element.

Time Complexity: O(1)

6. Heapify Operation

Heapify is the process of maintaining heap property.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

7. Build Heap

Bottom-up approach:Start heapifying from last non-leaf node.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Array Representation of Heap

Heaps are typically stored in an array (no pointers needed).

Example:

Array: [50, 30, 40, 10, 20, 35, 25]

Index map:

• index 0 → 50 (root)

• children of 0 → index 1 (30) and 2 (40)

• children of 1 → index 3 (10) and 4 (20)
