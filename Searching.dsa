Searching

Searching is the process of finding a specific element in a list or array of data. The goal is to check whether the element exists, and if yes, find its position.

1. ðŸ”¢ Linear Search

How it works: Check each element in the list one by one from start to end.

Works on: Both sorted and unsorted lists.

Time complexity: O(n) â€“ slower for large lists.


Example:
Looking for 5 in [3, 8, 5, 12]:
Check 3 â†’ 8 â†’ 5 â†’ found!

2. âš¡ Binary Search

How it works: Repeatedly divide the sorted list into halves to find the target.

Works on: Sorted lists only.

Time complexity: O(log n) â€“ much faster than linear search for large lists.


Example:
Looking for 7 in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]:
Middle is 5 â†’ target is bigger â†’ search right half â†’ find 7.
