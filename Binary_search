##Binary_search
Binary search is a fast way to find a value in a sorted list.
Instead of checking every element one by one, it:
Looks at the middle element
If the target is equal → found
If the target is smaller → search the left half
If the target is larger → search the right half
Repeat until found or the list ends

#Important: The array must be sorted.

**Example
Array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Target: 6

#Steps:
Middle = 6 → match found 
Another target example: 10
Middle = 6 → target is bigger → go right
Middle = 8 → target is bigger → go right
Middle = 10 → found 

##Pseudocode
BinarySearch(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = length(array) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) / 2

        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid

        else if target < array[mid]:
            right = mid - 1

        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return -1   // target not found

*Time Complexity: O(log n) 
*Works only on sorted data
*Much faster than linear search for large datasets
