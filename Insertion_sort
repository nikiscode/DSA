   //insertion_sort
Insertion Sort works the way you sort playing cards in your hand.
It takes one element at a time and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.
##Example
Array:
[5, 3, 4, 1]

#steps
Step 1:
First element 5 is already sorted
Sorted part: [5]
Step 2:
Take 3, compare with 5
Shift 5 to the right
Result: [3, 5, 4, 1]
Step 3:
Take 4, compare with 5
Shift 5 right, insert 4
Result: [3, 4, 5, 1]
Step 4:
Take 1, shift all larger elements right
Result: [1, 3, 4, 5]

##Pseudocode 
InsertionSort(array, n)
    for i = 1 to n-1
        key = array[i]
        j = i - 1

        while j >= 0 and array[j] > key
            array[j + 1] = array[j]
            j = j - 1

        array[j + 1] = key
*Builds the sorted array one element at a time
*Very easy to understand
*Best case: O(n) (already sorted)
*Worst case: O(n²) (reverse order)
*Efficient for small datasets
